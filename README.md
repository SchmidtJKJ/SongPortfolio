# SongPortfolio
This program is a demo to simulate the registry of songs in a music app
The program deliberately uses dynamic arrays to store the information for the point was to implement the back end of a vector.
Search for a song uses linear search by iether the artist or the title or both. Assunming an artist does not have 2 songs of the same title it will return the firs occurence of the song title. On the other hand, by title returns all songs of the same title. Nad a search by artist returns all the song by that artist.
